## Basic docking
The following commands require ADFR, and need to be routed to the bin directory of ADFR. If ADFR10 is in the same directory you're running the bash terminal in, then you can use something like the following to activate the functions:
```
./ADFR10/bin/*your_command*
```
Where ```*your_command*``` is the command you wish to run.
